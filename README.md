# 30 Days 30 Android UI Building Challenge üöÄ

Welcome to my 30 days 30 Android UI building challenge! In this challenge, I built 30 different Android app frontends, one each day. Each app showcases a unique UI design, and I used various frameworks including Android Views, Compose, and Flutter. Below, you'll find a summary of today's app, along with screenshots, a YouTube video for live working, and the source link for the UI design inspiration.
